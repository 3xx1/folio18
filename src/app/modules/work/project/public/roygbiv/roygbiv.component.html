      <p>This is a music video for an electronica band, UQiYO’s single cut song titled “ROYGBIV”, which stands for initials of each color in a rainbow. I implemented a few algorithmic effects to process input clips: a line drawing effect with OpenCV, a fluid simulation effect and a deep learning style transfer. Even though the original videos are just ordinary sceneries and objects found in NYC, these different visual effects curve a storyline in the transition of scenes and illuminate different perspective of how humans can differently perceive a scenery.</p>
